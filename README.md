Future work
One thing that we would like to add in the future is functionality to get specific direction history based on the user login, we were considering adding a JSON file to read / write direction history to based on the specific user, but we were running into issues. Also when providing multiple directions we would like to show a map for each of the direction routes (A->B->C->D) (We would have a map for A->B, another for B->C, and another map for C->D.
